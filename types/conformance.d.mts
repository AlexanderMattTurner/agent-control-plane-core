/**
 * The control-plane conformance harness.
 *
 * Any adapter — the reference claude one, codex, or a future
 * cursor/cline/gemini-cli/aider translator — must pass this against its own
 * golden fixtures. It pins the two directions of the contract:
 *
 *   1. parse is golden: adapter.parse(native) deep-equals the fixture's
 *      normalized `event` (and never throws — an adapter that threw would fail
 *      here rather than in production).
 *   2. render is golden: for each verdict scenario, adapter.render(verdict,
 *      parsedEvent) deep-equals the fixture's native response. An `allow` with
 *      the unmutated input renders to the agent's native allow; deny/ask/mutation
 *      each render to their native shape.
 *   3. non-vacuity: the fixture set collectively renders an allow, a deny, an
 *      ask, AND a mutated_input, so a suite can't pass while silently skipping a
 *      decision the contract requires every adapter to express.
 *   4. enforcement honesty: an enforceable deny (`rendered.enforced === true`)
 *      MUST carry a real block signal — a non-zero `exit_code` or a `throw_` —
 *      not just a JSON body the agent is free to ignore. At least one enforced
 *      deny must appear, so the honesty check is never vacuous.
 *   5. non-vetoable honesty: when the parsed event's `this_call_vetoable` is
 *      false, EVERY render for that case must be `enforced === false` — a
 *      guardrail that cannot veto this call must never render as if it did.
 *   6. allow = abstain: by default (no `soleGate` opt-in) every `allow` render
 *      is `enforced === false` AND `exit_code === 0` — an "I have no objection"
 *      verdict never renders as a block, on any adapter. At least one `allow`
 *      must be rendered, so this is never vacuous.
 *
 * `assert` is injected (node:assert/strict) so the harness stays test-framework
 * neutral; it throws on the first mismatch. Returns a summary the caller can
 * assert further on.
 *
 * @param {{ adapter: import("./control-plane.mjs").Adapter, fixtures: any, assert: any }} args
 * @returns {{ cases: number, renders: number, decisionsSeen: Set<string>, mutationSeen: boolean, enforcedDenySeen: boolean }}
